# SARS-CoV-2 - vaccine to MIDI

The whole vaccine (mRNA sequence) mapped to music.

Based on SARS-CoV-2 BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine.

Allows vaccine remixing fun.

A, C, G nucleotides are mapped to equivalent pitches.
Î¨ (1-methyl-3'-pseudouridylyl, T replacement) is a pause (silence)

Output MIDI has 4 channels, but you can easily configure anything else.
