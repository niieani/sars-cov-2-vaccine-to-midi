# SARS-CoV-2 - vaccine to MIDI

The whole vaccine (mRNA sequence) mapped to music.

Based on SARS-CoV-2 BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine.

Allows vaccine remixing fun.

If you make music from this, please use the hashtag #remixthevirus or #remixthevaccine when posting. :)

## How?

A, C, G nucleotides are mapped to equivalent musical notes, while the Î¨ (1-methyl-3'-pseudouridylyl) is currently a closed hi-hat sound. But you can also mute it and make it into a pause (silence) or choose another pitch of your choosing.

Output MIDI has 4 channels, but you can easily configure anything else.
